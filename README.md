# Expense Manager App (formerly `mini_social_application`)

This repository currently contains a Flutter project originally named
`mini_social_application`. The project's intended purpose is an
Expense Manager App — a lightweight app for tracking expenses, incomes,
and categories.

This README was added/updated to prepare the repository for an initial
push to GitHub and for a subsequent rename of the app to
"Expense Manager App".

Quick start
-----------

1. Install Flutter: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
2. From the project root run:

	flutter pub get
	flutter run

Notes about repository and next steps
------------------------------------

- I will initialize a local Git repo and create an initial commit that
  includes this README and the existing project files.
- Before making structural changes (renaming package identifiers,
  Android/iOS display names, etc.) you requested that the project be
  pushed to GitHub. I need the remote repository URL (for example
  `https://github.com/username/repo.git`) or instructions to create one.

After you provide the remote URL I will:

1. Add the remote as `origin` and push the initial commit.
2. Rename the project metadata and package identifiers to
	"Expense Manager App" (Android/iOS/Flutter), then run a smoke build.
3. Update this README with usage instructions, build badges, and a
	short changelog.

If you'd like, I can also provide or add a CONTRIBUTING.md and a
LICENSE file — tell me which license you'd prefer.

Contact / notes
---------------
If you want me to push to GitHub, please provide the repo URL and let
me know if it should be public or private. I can't create remote
repositories without credentials/authorization from you.
